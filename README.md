# NISTRandomNumber-Tests-MATLABcodes
National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) developed 15 Tests for checking the Randomness of Random Number Generators. I have developed the Tests in MATLAB. The codes are working under some fixed circumstances with defined Parameters.

A Statistical Test Suite for Random and Pseudorandom Number Generators for Cryptographic Applications
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These tests are considered to be the bible of True Randomness.

The 15 tests are:
1. The Frequency (Monobit) Test,
2. Frequency Test within a Block,
3. The Runs Test,
4. Tests for the Longest-Run-of-Ones in a Block,
5. The Binary Matrix Rank Test,
6. The Discrete Fourier Transform (Spectral) Test,
7. The Non-overlapping Template Matching Test,
8. The Overlapping Template Matching Test,
9. Maurer's "Universal Statistical" Test,
10. The Linear Complexity Test,
11. The Serial Test,
12. The Approximate Entropy Test,
13. The Cumulative Sums (Cusums) Test,
14. The Random Excursions Test, and
15. The Random Excursions Variant Test.

I HAVE FINISHED TEST NO.: 1,2,3,4,5,6,11,12,13 & 15
TEST NO. 7,8,9,10 & 14 are under development.

The above MATLAB Codes have a Variable named VOLTAGELEVVALS;
VOLTAGELEVVALS : It is the name of the Imported Random Number Bits
